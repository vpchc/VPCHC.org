      <p>&ldquo;I met with you in the Clinton office in February.&nbsp; At that time, I explained all the frustration and problems I&rsquo;ve had trying to obtain affordable health care.&nbsp; Prior to our meeting, I had applied for HIP through the state of Indiana. I am so happy to let you know that I finally received a letter that I have been approved for the Health Indiana Plan! I&rsquo;m so happy that I finally will have some insurance for at least the next 12 months! Thanks again for the time you took talking to me and trying to get through the Insurance Marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="newsboxed">Terre Haute Tribune Star - Community Progess Update</h3>
<p class="newsboxed">August, 2015</p>
<p class="newsboxed">What questions come to mind when searching for a healthcare provider? Will I receive quality
care? I don't have health insurance; can I afford to be seen by a doctor? How will I be able to
afford the prescribed medication? When will I have extra time to wait around in a doctor's
office?<br /> Does this sound like you?</p>

      <h6 class="homeboxmargin">When visiting Valley Professionals Community Health Center, please bring your driver&rsquo;s license and insurance information to each visit. Should any information change between visits, please inform the medical receptionist, so we can update your records.</h6>
      <h6 class="homeboxmargin style1">When you arrive, the front office will make a copy of your medical insurance card and verify that your account information is up-to-date. A nurse will&nbsp;complete your medical history after you have been checked in, but please bring any relevant medical information, including all names and dosages of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications that you are currently taking.</h6>
      <h6 class="homeboxmargin style1">Please note that all co-pays are to be paid at the time of the visit. VPCHC accepts Medicaid, Medicare and most private insurance. Please contact your insurance provider to verify that VPCHC is an in-network provider in order to receive maximum benefits from your plan, since each employer (and their insurance coverage) is unique. If VPCHC does not participate with your insurance company, prepayment or other arrangements are required before our services are provided.</h6>

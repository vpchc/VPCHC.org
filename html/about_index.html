      <p>Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center provides comprehensive primary health care and related services for ALL individuals and families.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>HISTORY OF VPCHC </p>
      <p>The Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center (VPCHC) is dedicated in serving their mission, to &ldquo;provide comprehensive primary health care and related services for ALL individuals and families.&rdquo; <br />
      VPCHC provides primary and preventive health care services, along with behavioral health services to the citizens of Vermillion and Parke counties, located in west central Indiana.</p>
      <p>Currently, VPCHC serves a significant need in offering primary and behavioral health care services to individuals and families in the surrounding communities and rural areas. The health center has two facility sites, located in Clinton and Cayuga, Indiana.  Both facilities are located in Vermillion County.</p>
      <p>In February 2008, the Clinton facility opened to begin serving patients with primary care services. At this time, the health center began with only a few staff members and served just over 1,500 patients, with 3,500 patient visits in 2008. In late 2008, the clinic began providing integrated primary and behavioral health care services </p>
      <p>In 2009, the Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center &ndash; Cayuga Clinic opened as an FQHC satellite clinic, in November. The opening of the clinic was in direct response to the needs of the surrounding local community. The clinic also provides primary and behavioral healthcare services to an extremely rural population.  The Cayuga Clinic continues to grow on a monthly basis to serve more individuals and families in the surrounding areas. </p>
      <p>As VPCHC had been integrating primary and behavioral health care services since 2008, the health center was awarded a special exemplary project award for the VPCHC Telehealth Program in 2010, awarded by the Indiana Primary Health Care Association (IPHCA). The Telehealth program is a behavioral health service that is offered at both VPCHC locations.  This program allows patients to visit with physicians live over video, to receive immediate health care. In 2010, the clinic served over 3,514 patients with over 13,800 patient visits. </p>
      <p>In 2011, the health center is projected to serve over 6,250 patients and 20,000 patient visits.  VPCHC has grown more quickly than any expectations to meet the overwhelming need for primary and behavioral healthcare services in Parke and Vermillion counties.  In August 2011, VPCHC was awarded school-based health center funding through a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), made possible through the Affordable Care Act.  This grant will help VPCHC expand and provide more health care services to five school districts in Parke and Vermillion counties.  VPCHC received one of four grants throughout the state of Indiana. </p>
      <p>As VPCHC continues to grow through its patients and various programs and services it offers, the health center is looking to expand their facility space, to further meet the needs of its patients.  Additional construction and renovations are planned to be complete in summer of 2012.</p>
      <p>VPCHC looks forward to continue serving you and the needs of our local communities! </p>

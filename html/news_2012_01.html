      <p>January 5, 2012</p>
      <p>The Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center would like to welcome Family Practitioner, Elaine Carlson, M.D. </p>
      <p>Dr. Carlson is a 2008 graduate of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and completed her undergraduate studies at Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, New York. </p>
      <p>Dr. Carlson completed her medical residency training through Union Hospital Family Medicine Residency Program in Terre Haute, in 2011. She has also completed medical rotations at the Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center during her residency.<br />
  <br />
        Dr. Carlson enjoys practicing in family medicine, because &ldquo;When you have the opportunity to provide care to an entire family, you are truly able to know the patient as a whole.&rdquo; Other clinical interests include women&rsquo;s health, maternal child health, adolescent health, and international medicine.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Since Dr. Carlson completed her residency rotations at our clinic, we knew she would be a great fit for our clinic and our community.  She is committed to her patients and their healthcare.  We are honored to have such a wonderful physician to add to our staff,&rdquo; stated Elizabeth Burrows, CEO of VPCHC. </p>
      <p>Prior to medical school, Dr. Carlson served in the Peace Corps as a Community Health Agent in a rural village in Niger, West Africa. She also worked in Public Health in the city of Boston, with the Haitian community on HIV prevention initiatives.</p>
      <p>Dr. Carlson enjoys long-distance backpacking, hiking, and the outdoors.  She has hiked the 2,000-plus mile Appalachian Trail from Maine to Georgia three times, most recently in 2011. She has also recently run the Tecumseh Trail Marathon. </p>
      <p>Dr. Carlson will be seeing patients at the VPCHC Clinton office, and providing services during the VPCHC After-Hours Clinic.  The health center is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The After-Hours Clinic is open Monday through Thursday from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.at the Clinton facility.

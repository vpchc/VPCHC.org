      <h1>Testimonials</h1>
      <p>&ldquo;I would like to commend several employees of the health center regarding their care and concern of my daughter-in-law.  On November 5, 2012, I brought her into the office to see Samantha Volstorf, NP.  She had been in extreme back/leg pain for several weeks.  She had been in both emergency rooms in Clinton and Terre Haute.  She was given pain medication and a list of stretches to do and told she would be fine.  However, once she was taken back into the office for her appointment, everyone could see what extreme pain she was having.  Once Samantha had reviewed her history and examined her, she immediately changed all her medications to help alleviate her pain and discomfort.  Another person in your office found a wheelchair so I could get her back to the care.  Samantha also scheduled an MRI at Union Hospital in Terre Haute for 8:30 p.m. that evening.  The end result was a herniated disc. </p>
      <p>Michelle the nurse made numerous phone calls to get my daughter-in-law  into a neurosurgeon and she made sure her prescriptions were filled until that doctor&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
      <p>I took her to see the doctor on Friday, November 16th and she was told she needed surgery within a week or two to alleviate the pain and nerve damage.  On Monday, November 19th, she called the doctor to inform him she would go ahead with the surgery.  Surgery was performed the very next day at Union Hospital in Terre Haute and she is doing very well!</p>
      <p>Needless to say, without the care and concern of your staff, my daughter-in-law could be lying in excruciating pain, waiting to see a doctor.  I feel our community is so blessed to have this excellent health care facility, as well as such a caring and compassionate staff!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you for allowing me to do my job shadowing at your facility.  It was an enjoyable experience.  Your staff was very welcoming and helpful.  I was able to obtain a lot of information that will help me when I begin the clinical side of my program.  As a patient, I now understand what it takes to maintain patience and compassion as part of a healthcare time.  Both of which your staff showed while I was in their presence.  I appreciate the opportunity to sit and observe your nurse and receptionist.  I feel that job shadowing is a good tool to use when trying to decide if a career is something that you want to pursue.  I want to thank you for letting me see first-hand, that this is definitely something I want to continue and  look forward to making it my career choice.  Once again, I want to thank you and your staff personally, for such a wonderful experience.&rdquo;  </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My husband went to the Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center in early December with chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue.&nbsp; He saw &nbsp;Nurse Practitioner Christi Busenbark at the clinic; she immediately sprang into action knowing that he was in trouble and sent him to the Clinton Hospital for tests and then to see a cardiologist.&nbsp; After seeing the cardiologist, tests revealed that my husband had 100% and 90% blockages (front of the heart) and 75% and 70% blockages (back of the heart) and needed surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp; We met with a cardiac heart surgeon who told us that my husband was working with 35% to 40% heart capacity and desperately needed the operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband had a quadruple bypass and is progressing nicely.&nbsp; If it had not been for Christi, my husband could have lost his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you and a big thank you to Christi.&rdquo;</p>

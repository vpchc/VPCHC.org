      <h3>Mission statement </h3>
      <p>&ldquo;Valley Professionals Community Health Center provides comprehensive integrated healthcare for all individuals while promoting educational opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><br />
      </p>
      <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) is a local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) dedicated to providing comprehensive primary health care and related services for all individuals and families. VPCHC provides a variety of services, including primary health care and behavioral health care. </p>
      <p>Established in 2008, VPCHC continues to experience both significant and successful growth. Beginning with one health center, VPCHC has expanded to three health center facilities in Clinton, Cayuga (2009) and Bloomingdale (2013), Indiana, as well as a mobile school-based health center (2012). VPCHC also offers an after-hours clinic at the Clinton facility, Monday through Thursday evenings, to provide available services so patients can avoid the emergency room for primary health care needs. All VPCHC locations accept Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance. If an individual does not have any health care coverage, they may be eligible for a sliding fee scale. The sliding fee scale is based on family size and income.</p>
      <p>VPCHC continues to serve a significant need in offering integrated primary and behavioral health care services to individuals and families in the surrounding communities and rural areas. Behavioral health care focuses on increasing productive activity, fulfilling relationships, and improving the ability to adjust and cope with the stress of life. Behavioral health is necessary for personal well-being, family life, personal relationships and an individual&rsquo;s contribution to the community. VPCHC offers behavioral health care services at its locations in Clinton, Cayuga and Bloomingdale. Services include child/adolescent counseling, family counseling, crisis counseling, and testing or assessments (upon referral).</p>
      <p>In fact, the health center follows a unique model of integrating primary and behavioral health for patients, providing them the most efficient and available care. The idea of a &lsquo;healthy body, healthy mind&rsquo; for patients is experienced through the combination of primary care and behavioral health care. This method has proven successful for VPCHC, creating better overall patient care outcomes, while allowing medical providers and behavioral health care providers to collaborate together in their patient&rsquo;s care plan. </p>
      <p>In June 2013, VPCHC received recognition through the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a Patient Centered Medical Home with a Distinction in Patient Experience Reporting. The NCQA Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Recognition is the most widely-adopted model for transforming primary care practices into medical homes for patients. The Patient Centered Medical Home is an innovative program for improving primary care and is structured as a health care setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients and their personal physicians, and when appropriate, the patient&rsquo;s family. </p>
      <p>In order to receive this recognition, VPCHC met rigorous standards set forth by NCQA concerning patient access to care, care coordination, continuity of care and accountability, as well as quality and safety. The 12-18 month-long project included the review of all health center policies and procedures, as well as the creation and review of many reports on performance outcomes. Other ways this recognition was accomplished, included encouraging patients to take a more active role in their own healthcare management, increasing access to care through expanded office hours, and moving toward a more comprehensive, whole-person care orientation. </p>
      <p>With its initial kickoff in August 2012, during back to school time, the health center begins its second school year in 2013, of providing services through its Mobile School-Based Health Center (MSBHC). The MSBHC is a mobile medical clinic that travels to all 14 schools of the 4 school corporations in Parke and Vermillion counties. The mobile health center provides a full range of health care services so students can avoid health-related absences and get additional support to succeed in the classroom. </p>
      <p>The MSBHC provides scheduled, on-site access during the academic day when school is in session. Services include immunizations, school physicals, well-child visits, treating cold, fever, congestion, vomiting, and other symptoms. It is staffed by a Family Nurse Practitioner and nurse. In addition, the mobile health center has also been providing occupational health services for employers in the local communities, including in Parke, Vermillion and Vigo counties. </p>
      <p>The health center looks forward to its continuation of providing integrated primary health care and behavioral health care to the local and surrounding communities, expanding available patient services and serving as a certified medical home for current and future patients. </p>

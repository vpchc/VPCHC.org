    <p>Since February 2013, VPCHC has participated in a primary care collaborative initiated by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The focus of the initiative was on the needs of patients with or at-risk for chronic disease. VPCHC&rsquo;s team, worked to improve the health of diabetic patients, tobacco users, and obese patients. At the March 2014 Outcomes Congress, VPCHC presented its success to the ISDH, Dr. VanNess, the State Health Commissioner, and other healthcare organizations. Success was seen in a 16% drop in the tobacco user population that participated in the collaborative as well as a 26% increase in diabetic patient self-management.</p>

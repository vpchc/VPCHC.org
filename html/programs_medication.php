      <h1>Medication Assistance</h1>
      <p>For those patients who are uninsured or do not have a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, assistance for many medications can be obtained from the pharmaceutical industry. Although every pharmaceutical company has different qualifications, most base the program eligibility on the number of people in the household and annual income, OR will accept monthly income with documentation (pay stubs, Social Security payments, etc.). If a patient has not filed taxes and has no current income, the pharmaceutical companies require the IRS form 4506T, which will be provided by the company for the patient to complete.</p>
      <p>Patients must fill out required paperwork to begin the Medication Assistance application process, to verify if they are eligible. It can take between two to four weeks to receive approval and/or denial for the assistance program.</p>
      <p>A medical provider will work with the patient to prescribe generic medications whenever possible for cost savings, but there are cases in which no generic equivalent is available. The medical provider will refer the patient to the VPCHC social worker, who will provide the applications and notify the patient of the documents needed to complete the forms. Most pharmaceutical manufacturers ship medications to the VPCHC facilities, while some will ship the medications directly to the patient's home address.</p>

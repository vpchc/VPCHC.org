      <p><strong>Center Receives Federal School-Based Health Grant</strong></p>
      <p>December 20, 2011</p>
      <p>The Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center is in significant steps of development for their Mobile School-Based Health Center (MSBHC).  The MSBHC is being supported through a grant made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which helps clinics expand and provide more health care services at schools nationwide.</p>
      <p>The mobile clinic will travel to all 14 schools in the five school corporations of Parke and Vermillion counties and provide a full range of health care services so students can avoid health-related absences and get additional support to succeed in the classroom. VPCHC is planning for the mobile clinic to begin operations in summer 2012. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;On behalf of Turkey Run Community Schools, we are extremely excited about the possibilities available to the Turkey Run community through the mobile school-based health center.  Many of our students have limited access to health care due to financial limitations and transportation issues.  Furthermore, visits to the doctor often result in the loss of a full day of school instruction because of the time and distance to health providers.  The mobile health clinic will serve our school community in a cost efficient and timely manner.  I fully expect that our students will receive better health care resulting in better school performance with fewer missed days and a healthier well-being,&rdquo; stated Dr. Thomas Rohr, superintendent of Turkey Run Community School Corporation.  Dr. Rohr is also a member of the VPCHC Governing Board. </p>
      <p>The Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center is collaborating with Union Hospital&rsquo;s Richard G. Lugar Center for Rural Health to implement the MSBHC project. Sponsorship for the mobile clinic includes Union Hospital Health Group, Union Hospital Clinton, and MDwise.  These organizations will be assisting with the operational costs and publicity for the unit.</p>
      <p>Representatives will be meeting with the five school boards in the upcoming months to present the plan for serving patients on the mobile unit. Anyone wishing to obtain additional information regarding this project is encouraged to contact Elizabeth Burrows, CEO of Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center at (765) 832-1003.</p>

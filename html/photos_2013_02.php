    <p>REMC Multi-County Community Trust, Inc. (Operation Roundup) recently awarded Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center $2,300.00 for installation of a shore power building receptacle to enable the Mobile School Based Health Center (MSBHC) to connect directly to electricity. The MSBHC travels to five school corporations on a rotating basis so that the children may be seen on the bus at their respective school. This prevents children from missing school or parents from missing work to obtain medical services. Accepting the check is Elizabeth Burrows; CEO, Tiffani Martin; Manager of Human Resources, Jennifer Inman; Nurse Practitioner and Amy Clarkson, LPN.</p>

      <p>The Valley Professionals behavioral health team provided art therapy activities at the block party. They<br /> provided a blank canvas for children to cover with their own creations. Art therapy has proven beneficial<br /> to the development of self-awareness and positive self-esteem in children and young adults. As the young<br /> girl guides the brush along the canvas, she echoes the notion that VPCHC's mission is vital in shaping a<br /> positive and healthy future for generations to come.

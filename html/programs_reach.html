      <h1>Reach Out and Read </h1>
      <p>Thanks to &lsquo;Reading is Fundamental,&rsquo; (RIF) the Valley Professionals Community Health Center has been fortunate to receive funding to provide age-appropriate books to all children, age six months to 5 years, who are receiving their well-child examination. The VPCHC medical staff has received training from RIF and is encouraged to participate and mentor to parents the importance of reading to children. Research shows that children who read and are read-to perform better in school and can enjoy a lifelong love of reading and books.</p>
      <p>According to the Reach Out and Read program&rsquo;s website (<a href="http://www.reachoutandread.org">reachoutandread.org</a>), their mission is to prepare America&rsquo;s youngest children to succeed in school by partnering with doctors to prescribe books and encourage families to read together.</p>
      <p>Reach Out and Read is an evidence-based nonprofit organization that promotes early literacy and school readiness in pediatric exam rooms nationwide by giving new books to children and advice to parents about the importance of reading aloud.</p>
      <p>Reach Out and Read builds on the unique relationship between parents and medical providers to develop critical early reading skills in children, beginning at 6 months of age. The more than 3.9 million families served annually by Reach Out and Read read together more often, and their children enter kindergarten better prepared to succeed, with larger vocabularies, stronger language skills, and a six-month developmental edge over their peers.</p>

    <h1>Sliding Fee Scale </h1>
    <p>If patients are not covered by any type of medical insurance for their medical needs, a sliding fee scale is available for patients to receive a discounted rate. Discounts available are based on patient family size and income in accordance with the most recent U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines.</p>
    <p>The sliding fee scale is based upon the current income of all family members, and the number of people in the household. An individual who is unemployed, has no income and is being supported by others must provide documentation showing that no federal income taxes have been filed, and the person supporting the patient must provide written and signed documentation that they are providing food and shelter for the patient.</p>
    <p>In order to qualify for the sliding fee scale at VPCHC, patients and their families must have a combined income that falls within the  U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines. </p>
    <p><strong>Patients and their families must provide the following documents to verify gross income:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most recent tax filing with the IRS and/or W2&rsquo;s from employer(s)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>A copy of Social Security or Disability Award Letter(s) or unemployment statement(s). </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay stubs from all employers for the last 30-day period.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If unemployed, no income, and living with others, we require a signed and dated letter from the person providing support of the patient.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Driver&rsquo;s license </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Any other income that is direct deposited.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a patient does not present these documents on the day of the visit, documents must be received within 10 days, in order for the patient to receive the sliding fee scale rate, or the full service rate will be charged. If you have any questions about the Sliding Fee Scale discount program, please call one of our health center locations: Clinton (765) 828-1003, Cayuga (765) 492-9042, Bloomingdale (765) 498-9000.</p>

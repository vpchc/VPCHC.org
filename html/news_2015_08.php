      <h1>Summer Block Party</h1>
      <p>July 21, 2015</p>
      <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) is celebrating one last opportunity of<br /> summer fun, before students head back to school, by hosting their 2015 Summer Block Party on<br /> Friday, July 31st at Sportland Park in Clinton, from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The block party is<br /> being held in honor of the 50th anniversary of National Health Center Week (NHCW). The event<br /> is open to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The VPCHC Summer Block Party will feature lots of activities and fun for all, including local<br /> recording artist Abbi Scott, with special guest The Scott Webster Band. The event is a perfect<br /> opportunity for free family fun, with local community exhibitors, health education and<br /> screenings, fun zone, dunk tank, food, and more! Guests are encouraged to bring lawn chairs for<br /> the concert. There will be an opportunity for a meet and greet after the performance, in addition<br /> to available merchandise.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>By hosting this event, Valley Professionals would like to show thanks and appreciation for their<br /> patients, local community members, organizations, and businesses for their continued support,<br /> and show the importance of available primary and behavioral health care services they are able<br /> to provide in a rural population.&nbsp; <br />
      </p>
      <p>NHCW is celebrated annually, during the second week of August, as part of the national<br /> observance of celebrating the success of America's health centers, and raising awareness about<br /> the mission and accomplishments of health centers as local solutions for affordable and<br /> accessible health care. Health centers serve more than 22 million people nationwide, and are<br /> increasingly becoming the trusted provider of choice for many families, whether they are insured<br /> or not.   Evidence shows patients choose health centers because they are convenient, affordable,<br /> and offer a range of services from a team of caring professionals. Studies also show the quality<br /> of care at a health center is as good, or even better than private practices. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>"Every day I witness the value our health centers have on our patients, by providing a patient-<br />centered health care home for all," said T.J. Warren, Valley Professionals CEO. "When patients<br /> have a primary care provider they can trust, they are more likely to stay committed to their care,<br /> which in turn provides a healthier lifestyle. We provide a range of services on site, including<br /> primary care services, behavioral health services, and dental services. Our patients not only get<br /> the care they need under one roof, but they are treated as individuals, with dignity and respect.<br /> This is what health care should be, and what we celebrate during National Health Center Week."</p>

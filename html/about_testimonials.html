      <p>TESTIMONIALS PAGE </p>
      <p>&#8220;As a one-stop provider for everything from depression to diabetes, VPCHC delivers landmark services for rural Indiana, with caring and professional staff going the extra mile each time I visit. Truthfully, I wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere else.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;VPCHC provides wonderful care to me and my family. The staff and providers are easy to talk to and listen to what I have to say.  It&rsquo;s comforting to know I can find the quality care that my family needs, so close to home.&rdquo;     </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center has been a wonderful addition to the community.  When my family moved to this area from a large community, I had concerns about the quality and availability of health care for my family.  When I found VPCHC and began to utilize the facility and its providers, I was impressed by the quality of care and the helpfulness of the staff.  For such a small community, we are lucky to have such a place. </p>
      <p>I know that VPCHC also may have saved my life.  As Dr. Valera and the nurse practitioners listened to concerns that I had voiced to my prior physicians, that went unheard, my cancer was found in an early and extremely treatable stage.  I could not be more proud to recommend VPCHC to everyone I know.&rdquo;<br />

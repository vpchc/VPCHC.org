            <p><strong>Mobile School-Based Health Center to Begin August 2012</strong></p>
            <p>The Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) was awarded a School-Based Capital Program grant in July 2011, which is a one-time grant that would purchase and fully equip a mobile-based health center that will aid in the delivery of essential services to children. The grant is made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which helps clinics expand and provide more health care services at schools nationwide. </p>
            <p>The VPCHC Mobile School-Based Health Center (MSBHC) is a mobile medical clinic that will travel to all 14 schools in the five school corporations of Parke and Vermillion counties. The mobile clinic will provide a full range of health care services so students can avoid health-related absences and get additional support to succeed in the classroom. The MSBHC will provide scheduled, on-site access during the academic day when school is in session. Every student is eligible to enroll into the MSBHC, but must have an enrollment form on file in order to receive any health care services.</p>
            <p>The mobile clinic will provide health services for acute problems, such as: immunizations, school physicals, Well-child visits, cold, fever, vomiting, congestion, sore throat, flu symptoms, cough, rash, earache, etc. </p>
            <p>The mobile clinic will be staffed by a Family Nurse Practitioner and support staff. Amy Clarkson, LPN, a 4-year clinical employee of VPCHC, will be fulfilling the support staff nursing position to assist the Nurse Practitioner in the care and treatment of students enrolled in the MSBHC.</p>
            <p>The MSBHC accepts Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance. If a student does not have any health care coverage, they may be eligible for sliding fee scale. Health care coverage information will be collected from the MSBHC student enrollment form. If a student is enrolled in the MSBHC, their insurance or health care coverage will be billed for any services the student receives. No form of payments will be exchanged when services are provided on the mobile clinic. </p>
            <p>The mobile clinic will travel to all the following schools within Parke and Vermillion counties: North Vermillion Elementary, North Vermillion JR/SR High School, Central Elementary, Ernie Pyle Elementary, Van Duyn Elementary, South Vermillion Middle School, South Vermillion High School, Rockville Elementary, Rockville JR/SR High School, Montezuma Elementary, Rosedale Elementary, Riverton Parke JR/SR High School, Turkey Run School Elementary and Turkey Run JR/SR High School.</p>
            <p>Please contact VPCHC with any questions or for additional information.  Enrollment forms are available at VPCHC offices and with individual school nurses. </p>
            <p>The Valley Professionals Community Health Center Clinton and Cayuga locations are open Monday - Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The after-hours clinic is open Monday - Thursday, 5:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.  Contact the Clinton office at (765) 828-1003 or 777 S.

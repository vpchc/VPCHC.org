      <p><strong>Health Center to Begin After-Hours Clinic</strong></p>
      <p>Beginning January 3, 2012, the Valley Professionals Community Health Center will begin operating an after-hours clinic at their Clinton facility. The after-hours clinic will be open after normal business hours, from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday.</p>
      <p>The after-hours clinic has been created to allow the opportunity of late appointments, for those who can&rsquo;t access their medical care provider during the daytime hours.  The after-hours clinic is also working in partnership with Union Hospital Clinton, to help reduce the amount of emergency room visits, for symptoms that can be treated by a primary care provider. </p>
      <p>The after-hours clinic services will be available to all individuals and families. Appointments are available and walk-ins are welcome. Those seeking medical treatment after hours, do not have to be a current patient of VPCHC to receive treatment at the clinic.  VPCHC accepts Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance and offers a sliding fee scale. </p>
      <p>Dr. Elaine Carlson will be an available provider during the after-hours clinic. Dr. Carlson completed a rotation at VPCHC during her residency and has spent many hours at the health center providing care to patients.  Family Nurse Practitioner, Christi Busenbark, will also be providing patient care during the after-hours clinic.  Busenbark is currently seeing patients at the VPCHC Clinton office and is a local Parke County resident.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or looking for more information about VPCHC&rsquo;s after-hours clinic, please call our Clinton office at (765) 828-1003.</p>

      <p><strong>New Doctor Joins Local Health Center</strong></p>
      <p>September 14, 2011</p>
      <p>The Valley Professionals Community Health Center would like to welcome Family Practitioner, Bob Ehresman, M.D. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ehresman completed his medical training and graduated from Indiana University School of Medicine in 2008, and completed his undergraduate studies at Indiana State University, graduating in 2004. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ehresman completed his residency training through Union Hospital Family Medicine Residency in Terre Haute, and was chief resident during his final year, 2010-2011.</p>
      <p> He has resided in the Wabash Valley since the beginning of his residency in 2008, and prior to that as a student at ISU. Dr. Ehresman previously completed electives at the Valley Professionals Community Health Center during his second and third years of residency.</p>
      <p>Dr. Ehresman found family medicine most appealing, because &ldquo;you get to know the patient and their family so well,&rdquo; as well as the challenges involved in managing such a wide variety of medical issues. </p>
      <p>Other clinical interests include chronic disease management, adolescent health, preventative care, newborn care, and prenatal care. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are excited to have Dr. Ehresman providing services at our health center.  His commitment to the patients, and providing quality patient care will be an invaluable addition to our staff,&rdquo; stated Elizabeth Burrows, CEO of VPCHC. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ehresman is the oldest of three children, and enjoys fishing, music, history, and Chicago Cubs baseball. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ehresman will be seeing patients at the VPCHC Clinton office.  The health center is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  If you have any questions, or would like to schedule an appointment, call the office at (765) 832-1003.</p>

      <p><strong>Health Center Growth Requires Facility Expansion</strong></p>
      <p>December 9, 2011</p>
      <p>The Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC), a federally-qualified health center, has currently begun its facility expansion and renovations, to further develop its health care capabilities and patient services.  The new space will facilitate the continual progress of VPCHC services, by expanding its office space and patient care capabilities.</p>
      <p>VPCHC was recently awarded grand funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Health Center Capital Improvement Program Initiative. The purpose of this award is to expand availability for needed primary health care services, specifically by expanding services at existing health center sites in an underserved medical area. The awarded grant funding is designed to allow VPCHC to increase services at its existing locations, address the growth in demand to serve patients in the local community and surrounding areas, to improve health information technology, and conduct renovations and construction for the growth and development of its services. </p>
      <p>The facility and construction renovations will allow for the addition and increase of patient exam rooms, larger waiting room area, additional on-site services, with an increase from 2,700 to 8,000 feet of facility space for the growth of the health center. The facility space will allow VPCHC to offer additional opportunities and resources for medical students, residents and other departments including psychology and behavioral health.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are extremely excited to have more space to better serve our current patients and have the capacity to serve additional patients.  There will be additional space for primary and behavioral health care.&rdquo;  Elizabeth Burrows, CEO.</p>
      <p>VPCHC is committed to continuous focus on patient care and maximizing the capabilities of patient services and programs. Please bear with the VPCHC staff during this time of construction renovation you may encounter when visiting us.  We do have disposable earplugs on hand, to assist with the construction noises you may experience, for your hearing pleasure!</p>

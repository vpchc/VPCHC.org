      <p><strong>Center Receives Federal School-Based Health Grant</strong></p>
      <p>August 18, 2011</p>
      <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, recently announced the Valley Professionals Community Health Center has been awarded a School-Based Capital Program grant. This grant is made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which helps clinics expand and provide more health care services at schools nationwide.</p>
      <p>The scope of Valley Professionals Community Health Center&rsquo;s (VPCHC) School-Based Capital grant project is to create a formal and collaborative relationship between the VPCHC and the five school corporations located in Parke and Vermillion counties to help children stay in school by identifying and addressing health problems that may intervene in the learning process. &ldquo;We know that if kids aren&rsquo;t healthy then kids can&rsquo;t learn,&rdquo; said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. &ldquo;These grants will make it a lot easier for working moms and dads to help get their children the health care they need and deserve. This unprecedented investment in school-based health care will bring communities closer together and help children succeed in the classroom.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>This one-time grant will purchase and fully equip a mobile-based health center that will aid in the delivery of essential services to children attending any school within the five Parke and Vermillion County school corporations. &ldquo;We are very excited to collaborate with our local schools,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Burrows, CEO of Vermillion Parke Community Health Center. &ldquo;This grant will allow our health center to provide much needed outreach to supplement and implement new services to the schools, while assisting students to meet their maximum potential.&rdquo;<br />
          <br />
        The Valley Professionals Community Health Center is collaborating with Union Hospital&rsquo;s Richard G. Lugar Center for Rural Health to implement the project. A meeting among the corporations&rsquo; superintendents will be held on August 25, 2011 to discuss project plans and details. Anyone wishing to obtain additional information regarding this project is encouraged to contact Elizabeth Burrows, CEO of Valley Professionals Community Health Center at (765) 832-1003.</p>

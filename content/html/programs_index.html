      <p><strong><a href="programs_sfs.php">Sliding Fee Scale</a></strong><br />
      If patients are not covered by any type of medical insurance for their medical needs, a sliding fee scale is available for patients to receive a discounted rate.

        <strong><a href="programs_medication.php">Medication Assistance</a></strong> <br />
        For those patients who are uninsured or do not have a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, assistance for many medications may be obtained from the pharmaceutical industry. Patients must fill out required paperwork to begin the Medication Assistance application process, to verify if they are eligible. A medical provider will work with the patient to prescribe generic medications whenever possible for cost savings, but there are cases in which no generic equivalent is available. </p>

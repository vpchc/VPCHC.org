      <p><strong>4-H FUNfest &amp; AG Day! </strong><br />
March 10th, 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. at the Vermillion County Fairgrounds&nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>Valley Professionals Community Health Center is participating in the upcoming 4-H FUNfest/Ag Day event, that is being held on Saturday, March 10th, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Vermillion-County Fairgrounds.</p>
      <p>This event is sponsored by the 4-H Jr. Leaders and will host a variety of games, a silent auction, various agriculture and community booths, food, etc. This is a fun, family-oriented activity and a fun time for both children and parents!<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        VPCHC will have a booth at the event, providing information about services, medical and behavioral providers, patient programs, and much more!  There will also be a fun activity available for children at the event and free VPCHC giveaways!</p>
      <p>A few of VPCHC&rsquo;s medical providers will also be at the VPCHC booth, for a meet and greet opportunity.  VPCHC wants to provide this as an opportunity for those in the community to become a little more familiar with the care that is available for them at the health center.</p>
      <p>We hope to see you at the VPCHC booth on Saturday, March 10th at the 4-H FUNfest &amp; AG Day event!</p>

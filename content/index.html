            <p><strong>Mobile School-Based Health Center to Begin August 2012</strong></p>
            <p>The Valley Professionals Community Health Center (VPCHC) was awarded a School-Based Capital Program grant in July 2011, which is a one-time grant that would purchase and fully equip a mobile-based health center that will aid in the delivery of essential services to children. The grant is made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which helps clinics expand and provide more health care services at schools nationwide. </p>
            <p>The VPCHC Mobile School-Based Health Center (MSBHC) is a mobile medical clinic that will travel to all 14 schools in the five school corporations of Parke and Vermillion counties. The mobile clinic will provide a full range of health care services so students can avoid health-related absences and get additional support to succeed in the classroom. The MSBHC will provide scheduled, on-site access during the academic day when school is in session. </p>

  When visiting Valley Professionals Community Health Center, please bring your driver&rsquo;s license and insurance information to each visit.  Should any information change between visits, please inform the medical receptionist, so we can update your records. </p>
      <p class="style2">When you arrive, the front office will make a copy of your medical insurance card and verify that your account information is up-to-date. A nurse will&nbsp;complete your medical history after you have been checked in, but please bring any relevant medical information, including all names and dosages of prescriptions and over-the-counter medications that you are currently taking.</p>
      <p class="style2">Please note that all co-pays are to be paid at the time of the visit. VPCHC accepts Medicaid, Medicare and most private insurance. Please contact your insurance provider to verify that VPCHC is an in-network provider in order to receive maximum benefits from your plan, since each employer (and their insurance coverage) is unique. If VPCHC does not participate with your insurance company, prepayment or other arrangements are required before our services are provided. </p>

      <p><strong>Speaking From the Heart &ndash;  Telecardiology Services</strong></p>
      <p>October 18, 2011</p>
      <p>While your primary care physician can manage most of your day-to-day health problems, there are times when you should see a cardiologist who is trained and an expert in recognizing signs of heart disease for more serious problems. A cardiologist can run tests and take a more in-depth look and help you understand what it is you need to do to keep your heart healthy and strong. There might be times in your life when seeing a cardiologist is your best choice for staying in control of your heart health. You can now see a Providence Medical Group Cardiologist at Vermillion-Parke Community Health Center&rsquo;s Cayuga Clinic.</p>
      <p>If you are having unexplained chest pain, then you should probably take the time to see a cardiologist. Chest pain or discomfort, especially when it lasts for days at a time can be a warning sign to heart disease, and even a precursor to heart attacks. If you experience sudden chest pain or pressure, heavy sweating, sudden weakness, pain in your back, neck, jaw or arm, or lightheadedness, you may be having a heart attack. Call 911 immediately!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What can you do?</li>
        <li>Check your cholesterol and blood pressure levels. High blood pressure or cholesterol can put you at greater risk for heart disease.</li>
        <li>Watch your diet and weight to keep cholesterol and blood pressure levels down. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and saturated fat.</li>
        <li>Stop smoking. Smoking speeds up the development of atherosclerosis by damaging the artery walls, which allows cholesterol deposits to develop.</li>
        <li>Exercise regularly to help prevent a heart attack and increase your chances of surviving one.</li>
        <li>Reduce stress.</li>
        <li>Limit caffeine and alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether other conditions put you at higher risk for heart disease. For example High cholesterol and diabetes may add to your risk of a heart attack.</li>
        <li>Let your doctor know if you have a family history of heart disease.</li>
      </ul>
